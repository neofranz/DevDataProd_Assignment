Quick introduction
------------------

* This application allows you to explore and try out different linear regression models for car fuel consumption (MPG).
* The raw data is the `mtcars` dataset included in the standard distribution of R.
* You can select the variable on which to regress, and whether you want to include the intercept.
* If you don't specify any variables than MPG will be regressed against all other variables.
* You can examine the raw data in the *Data* tab.
